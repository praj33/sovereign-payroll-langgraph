# 🏛️ Sovereign Payroll Automation — LangGraph Engine (v1.0)

A production-aligned payroll automation system built using **LangGraph + Python**, fully migrated from n8n and integrated with the **Sovereign Core evaluation layer**.

This engine processes biometric attendance and timesheet data, calculates attendance and salary, exports Excel payroll reports, and automatically generates **Sovereign readiness metadata** with scores and review notes.
